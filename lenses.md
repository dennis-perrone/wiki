## Notes

- Focal length is the distance from where the light enters the lens to the sensor.
- The smaller the focal length, the wider the shot.
- Aperture is how much light is being let in.
- Lower aperture lets in a lot of light and gives a shallow depth of field:
  - This gives a blurry background with sharp subject.
  - The lower the number, the less things in focus.
- Prime lenses are typically faster but don't have variables focal lengths.
  - Typically better image but less versatile.
