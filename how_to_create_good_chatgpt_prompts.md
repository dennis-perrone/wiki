## Notes

- There are six components:
  - Task (Mandatory)
  - Context (Important)
  - Exemplar (Important)
  - Persona (Important)
  - Format (Nice to Have)
  - Tone (Nice to Have)
- Always start with a task (verb)
- Context:
  - What is the users background?
  - What does success look like?
  - What environment are they in?
- Exemplars (examples) are not required but increase the quality of the output.
- Persona:
  - Who is somebody you wish you had instant access too?
  - Examples:
    - Job seeker would love to talk with a hiring manager
    - Working on a brief would love to talk to a senior product marketing manager
- When asking ChatGPT to proof read something, specify that it needs to bold changes.
- Specify tone:
  - Casual
  - Formal

## Examples

- I received a lengthy industry report from my director.
  - Ask ChatGPT to give me the 3 key take aways then summarize based on topic.
  - Use h2 as section headers.
  - Here is the report below:
    - <submit report text>
- Proofread the email below and correct all typos and grammar mistakes. Bold all changes you make.
  - <paste email>
