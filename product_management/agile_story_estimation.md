# Agile Story Estimation

- What are Agile estimates?
  - Quantified evaluations of the level of effort needed to complete tasks.
  - Results are used as project guidelines.
- Estimates != commitments since other higher priority tasks may come up.
- Why do we estimate:
  - Helps to prioritize features.
  - Historical data can help with release planning.
  - Can help with conversations around defining scope.
  - Can help improve the collective understanding of the project.
  - Can potentially increase morale.
- Estimate challenges:
  - There can be issues that pop up throughout the sprint.
  - Time can be impacted by workplace distractions and/or personal fatigue
- These can be made alone, but collaborative estimates can produce better results.
- High velocity != a successful team.
- Common techniques:
  - Ideal programming days: A perfect day with no meetings, distractions, etc.
  - Affinity mapping
  - T-shirt sizes: Based on t-shirt sizes (s, m, l, xl)
  - Story Points: Uses the Fibonacci sequence to determine points.
- How to estimate:
  - Read the story out loud with the team.
  - Check the teams confidence level before proceeding.
  - Estimate as a team.
  - Vote on estimates.
