# Agile Release Planning

## Notes

- A release plan is a high level plan for when features will be released and which features will be released.
- It is the project's map.
- Benefits of release planning:
  - Sets cadence for delivering value.
  - Sets the expectations
  - Synchronizes and validates the release goals.
- Creating a release plan (six steps):
  - Create the vision
  - Define the features/initiatives
  - Establish a roadmap
  - Estimate
  - Work in sprints
  - Track progress
- Common planning types:
  - Time box: Splits dev into split iterations with fixed time periods.
  - Flow based planning
- What is a vision statement?
  - A brief summary of how a product works into the company's strategy.
- Backlog: A prioritized list of features built off of the roadmap.
- A flat backlog can show priorities as colors.
- A roadmap is a course-of-action (COA) for how a product will evolve over time.
- Creating a user story map (seven steps):
  - Understand the users needs
  - Learn who the users are
  - Map common activities
  - Create statuses from activity
  - Assign priority to the story
  - Identify gaps, dependencies, and requirements
  - Plan iterations and releases.
