# The Lean Product Playbook

## Summary

- Recommended by Jamie Fisher as a good book to learn more about [Product Management](/notes/docs/product_management.md).
- This book gives a good understanding of how to generate an [MVP](/notes/docs/minimum_viable_product.md) and find [Product Market Fit]().

## Notes

- To take advantage of the [Product Market Fit (PMF) Pyramid](/notes/docs/pmf_pyramid.md), use the [Lean Product Process](/notes/docs/lean_product_process.md) (LPP).
- Separate the *problem space* from the *solution space*.
- **Solution Space:** Any product or representation of a product.
- **Problem Space:** There is no product or design that satisfies the customer needs.
- Fully understanding the whole market is critical to identifying potentially successful products. This is called *Problem Space Understanding*.
- Types of [product teams]():
  - **Outside-In** product teams start with understanding the customer's problem space.
  - **Inside-Out** product teams are when idea's start internally without understanding the customer's problem space.
- Types of [product markets]():
  - **Up market:** Selling to *small businesses* and wanting to start selling to *large businesses*.
  - **Down market:** Selling to *large businesses* and wanting to start selling to *small businesses*.
- Define target customer attributes. These can be:
  - Demographics
  - Behaviors
  - Psychographic
- **Demographics** are quantifiable statistics such as:
  - Age
  - Gender
  - Marital status
  - Income
  - Education level
- **Firmographics** are traits of a company/site/industry.
  - Standards:
    - Standard Industrial Classification (SIC)
    - North American Industry Certification System (NAICS)
- **Psychographics** is how people are classified based on psychological variables:
  - Attitudes
  - Opinions
  - Values
  - Interests
- A [User Persona](/notes/docs/user_persona.md) is representative of a user and defines what he/she wants to accomplish.
- Helps to align developers to solve the same problem.
- Good way to capture hypothesis.
- Display relevant *demographic*, *psychographic*, *behavior*, and *needs based* attributes of the target customers.
- Should represent an actual user and not the *average user*.
- These **are not** a substitute for talking to customers.
- Customer need = customer benefit when it comes to identifying what a customer needs out of a product.
