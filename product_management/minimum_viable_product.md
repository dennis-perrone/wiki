- Risks are offset by opportunity.
- MVP's should be done quickly.
- **Seven** steps process to develop an MVP:
  - Product solution
  - Identify assumptions
  - Build testable hypothesis
  - Establish [[Minimum Criteria for Success]] (MCS)
  - MCS gives clarity and meaning.
  - Pick MVP strategy
  - Execute, iterate
  - Evaluate
- Put together a hypothesis:
  - The difference between a **hypothesis** and an **assumption** is that a **hypothesis** is *actionable*.
  - Examples:
    - We believe `___` will `___` because `___`.
    - If we `___`, we believe `___` will `___` because `___`.
- Common assumptions:
  - My customer(s) have *x*,*y*,and *z* problem.
  - `___` matters to my customer.
  - `___` will pay for it.
  - There are no satisfactory substitutes.
- Outcome of an MVP test:
  - Your **hypothesis** is **false** and *not worth doing*.
  - Your **hypothesis** is **true** *without question*.
  - A combination of both.
- Risk / Difficulty Square

- Techniques:
  - **Email MVP:** Communicate via email. Pitches *new products*.
  - **Shadow Button MVP:** A dummy button within an application. Registers the selection to measure the desire.
  - **404/Coming Soon:** Acts like a shadow button. Shows products which may not exists to judge the demand for that product or feature.
  - For this MVP, decide if you would rather users think that something is *broken* or think they were *misled*.
  - **Explainer:** A video that explains the product. Also known as *smoke and mirror*.
    - **Sales Explainer:** A fake advertisement.
  - Can excite the user base.
    - Typically, has a high conversion rate.
  - **Fake Landing Page:** Page that shows all the benefits of a product.*
  - **Pitch Experiment:** Pitches a *feature* to an online audience.
  - **Concierge:** Informal offering to a small user set.
  - **Piecemeal:** Take COTS software to replicate the functionality before developing own solution.
  - **Wizard of Oz:** Manual processes being done behind the scenes that will eventually be automated.
- Determine the MVP but knowing the organizations risk appetite.
- MVP Setup:
  - Come up with an idea.
  - Design an experiment.
  - Set up expectations.
  - Test the MVP.
