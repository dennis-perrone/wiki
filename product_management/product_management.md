- There are **four** types of customer interviews:
  - **Exploratory:** Determine what the customer has issues with.
  - **Validation:**
    - Validate theory with the customer's needs and wants.
    - Be sensitive to bias. Preset ideas in a way to solicit honest feedback.
  - **Satisfactions status**
  - **Efficiency:** How does this product fit into the customers' life.
- There will be different types of interview pre-product launch and post-product launch.
- There are **four** steps of [customer development](../docs/customer_development.md):
  - **Step 1:** Figure out whom you're targeting.
  - **Step 2:** Find candidates that match the target group.
  - **Step 3:** Reach out and agree to talk.
  - **Step 4:** Interview the people.
- There is roughly a **3 to 1** ratio of emails versus people you want to interview.
  - Keep emails between **four and seven** sentences.
  - Be personable and add details on how you found them.
  - Mention that you are **not from sales**.
- When conducting the interview, let them talk and embrace them going on a tangent.
  - **Guide** the conversation, don't **force** it.
  - Ask open-ended questions. This helps facilitate the conversation.
- [User Persona](../docs/user_persona.md):
  - A hypothetical user used to help model discussions.
  - Represents different types of users.
  - Gives a reference point for a feature.
- The **data diet** and things to be mindful of:
  - Customer interviews don't scale.
  - The data is **qualitative**.
- [Minimum Viable Product](../docs/minimum_viable_product.md) (MVP):
  - The version of a new product that allows the team to collect the **maximum amount of data** with the **least amount of effort**.
  - Designed to test a hypothesis.
- Validated learning:
  - Done in a **test environment**.
  - Doesn't add bias to the customer.
- Pick **one** metric for success and know what needs to be improved.
- **Validation metrics:** help determine if the product is a good idea.
  - They can be used to show or confirm an actual need for the product.
- There needs to be both **qualitative** and **quantitative** analysis on the results of the [MVP](../docs/minimum_viable_product.md).
