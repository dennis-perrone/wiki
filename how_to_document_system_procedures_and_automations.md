## Notes

- Structure everything in the form of a question. This should make it a little bit easier to find.
- For example:
  - How do I put in a hardware ticket?
  - How do I do a virtual machine restore?
  - How do I verify automated script for system X?
  - How do I check-out a password from our vault?
- Try and address the following items in the procedures:
  - Overview - Describe the point of the document.
  - Prerequisites - What access is needed?
  - When - When is this performed?
  - How - Basic steps to get a user to taking action against the question.
  - References - uploaded templates, references to architecture pages, etc.
- For organizational purposes, we use a labeling schema as eventually you'll amass a bunch of these questions/answers with little structure. We use a labeling structure as such:
  - [team]-faq-[function]
  - For example: infra-faq-general, infra-faq-veeam, infra-faq-onboarding
- Create a template to standardize across the org.
